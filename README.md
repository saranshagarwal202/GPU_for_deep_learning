# GPU_for_deep_learning

This project was presented in Nov/2020 as a part of research seminar at Manipal Institute of Technology.

## ABSTRACT

GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) enables faster matrix calculations than a CPU (Central Processing Unit). This is an important piece of hardware when it comes to digital image processing for various applications. The research in the development of the GPUs gave rise to research in Artificial Intelligence. Training a model for supervised learning can be an extremely time consuming task. Soon enough, the solution was found in the parallel processing power that the GPU offers. In my study, I have attempted to show how the training time compares for the CPU and the GPU.
